                question: "Your company plans to migrate all its data and resources to Azure. The company's migration plan states that only platform as a service (PaaS) solutions must be used in Azure. You need to deploy an Azure environment that supports the planned migration. Solution: You create an Azure App Service and Azure SQL databases. Does this meet the goal?",

                    "Yes",
                    "No"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 0,
                explanation: "Azure App Service and Azure SQL databases are examples of Azure PaaS solutions. Therefore, this solution does meet the goal."

The company's migration plan states that only platform as a service (PaaS) solutions must be used in Azure. You need to deploy an Azure environment that supports the planned migration. Solution: You create an Azure App Service and Azure virtual machines that have Microsoft SQL Server installed. Does this meet the goal?",

                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "Azure App Service is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) service. However, Azure virtual machines are an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) service. Therefore, this solution does not meet the goal."

App1 has low usage during the first three weeks of each month and very high usage during the last week of each month. Which benefit of Azure Cloud Services supports cost management for this type of usage pattern?",

                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "Elasticity in this case is the ability to provide additional compute resource when needed and reduce the compute resource when not needed to reduce costs. Autoscaling is an example of elasticity."

You need to recommend a cloud deployment solution to minimize the amount of administrative effort used to manage the web application. What should you include in the recommendation?",

                correctAnswer: 3,
                explanation: "A hybrid cloud is a combination of a private cloud and a public cloud. Capital expenditure is the spending of money up-front for infrastructure such as new servers. With a hybrid cloud, you can continue to use the on-premises servers while adding new servers in the public cloud (Azure for example)."

                    "The public cloud is owned by the public, NOT a private corporation",
                    "The public cloud is a crowd-sourcing solution that provides corporations with the ability to enhance the cloud",

                ],
                correctAnswer: 3,
                explanation: "The public cloud is a shared entity whereby multiple corporations each use a portion of the resources in the cloud. The hardware resources (servers, infrastructure etc.) are managed by the cloud provider."

                question: "You plan to deploy several Azure virtual machines. You need to ensure that the services running on the virtual machines are available if a single data center fails. Solution: You deploy the virtual machines to two or more scale sets. Does this meet the goal?",
                options: [
                    "Yes",
                    "No"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "This answer does not specify that the scale set will be configured across multiple data centers so this solution does not meet the goal."

                correctAnswer: 0,
                explanation: "Availability zones expand the level of control you have to maintain the availability of the applications and data on your VMs. An Availability Zone is a physically separate zone, within an Azure region."

                ],
                correctAnswer: 0,
                explanation: "By deploying the virtual machines to two or more regions, you are deploying the virtual machines to multiple datacenters. This will ensure that the services running on the virtual machines are available if a single data center fails."
            },
            {
                number: 61,
                question: "You have 1,000 virtual machines hosted on the Hyper-V hosts in a data center. You plan to migrate all the virtual machines to an Azure pay-as-you-go subscription. You need to identify which expenditure model to use for the planned Azure solution. Which expenditure model should you identify?",

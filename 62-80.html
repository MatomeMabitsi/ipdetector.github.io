The company plans to reduce the following administrative responsibilities of network administrators: - Backing up application data - Replacing failed server hardware - Managing physical server security - Updating server operating systems - Managing permissions to shared documents. The company plans to migrate several servers to Azure virtual machines. You need to identify which administrative responsibilities will be reduced after the planned migration. Which two responsibilities should you identify? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.",
